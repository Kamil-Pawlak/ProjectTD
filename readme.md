# 🛡️ ProjectTD – A Tower Defense Game Built with Godot

## 📦 About the Game
ProjectTD is a solo-developed tower defense game built in Godot 4.4.1 as a side project for my portfolio. The goal is to create a polished and engaging game that showcases good game development practices, clean code structure, and a visually appealing user interface. This project also helps me explore and apply concepts like level design, enemy wave balancing, UI/UX in games, and Git-based version control in solo development.

## 🎮 Planned Features
- Multiple tower types with unique abilities
- Enemy waves with increasing difficulty
- Upgrade system for towers
- Grid-based map layout
- Simple but clean UI with health bars, currency, and wave indicators
- Pause and game-over states
- Basic sound effects and background music
- Cross-platform support (desktop focus for now)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Engine: Godot v4.4.1
- Language: GDScript (and optionally C# later)
- Version Control: Git + GitHub

## 📸 Screenshots
